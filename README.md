## Implementations and Testing on Several Models

This repository provides training and evaluation pipelines for several classical machine learning and deep learning models.

### Linear and Logistic Regression
Baseline models used for benchmarking and understanding feature importance across the dataset.

### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
A feedforward neural network implemented to capture nonlinear interactions in user–item or feature-based representations.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
A deep learning architecture applied to tasks requiring spatial feature extraction or structured input representations.

### ResNet
A residual network model used to improve training stability and performance in deeper architectures through skip connections.

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
A recurrent neural network architecture designed to model sequential patterns and temporal dependencies.

### BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
A transformer-based model leveraged for contextual embeddings, language understanding, or advanced feature learning.
