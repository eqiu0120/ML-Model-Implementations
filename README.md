## Implementations and Testing on Several Models

This repository provides training and evaluation pipelines for several classical and deep learning models:

### Linear and Logistic Regression
Baseline models used for benchmarking the recommendation performance and understanding feature importance.

### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
A feedforward neural network implemented to capture nonlinear interactions in user–item features.

### LSTM
Recurrent neural network model used to incorporate sequential patterns in user behavior.

### BERT
A transformer-based model leveraged for embedding and contextual representation in recommendation tasks.
